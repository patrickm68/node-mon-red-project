<script type="text/x-red" data-template-name="unknown">
    <div class="form-tips">This node is currently unknown to Node-RED. <i>DO NOT Deploy while in this state or the flow file may well be trashed...</i>. Usually this can be resolved by installing the npm module that this node relies on. To do this - stop Node-RED and restart. Look at the errors shown for one that matches this missing node. Stop Node-RED again and type <b>npm install {missing module name}</b>. Restart Node-RED, and hopefully this will have resolved it.</div>

    <p>Usually this can be resolved by installing the npm module that this node relies on. To do this, stop Node-RED and restart.</p>
    <p>Look at the errors shown in the console for one that matches the name of this missing node.</p>
    <p>Stop Node-RED again and type <b>npm install {missing module name}</b>. Restart Node-RED, and hopefully this will have resolved it.</p>
    <p>If not then you will need to obtain that Node-RED module from somewhere... ask the author of the flow where they got it from.</p>
    <p>(hopefully soon we will have a central repository where all nodes can be registered. work in progress.)</p>
