A visual tool for wiring the Internet of Things.

## Quick Start

Check out [INSTALL](INSTALL) for full instructions on getting started.

1. download the zip and unzip, or git clone
2. cd node-red
3. npm install
4. node red.js
5. Open [http://localhost:1880]

## Browser Support

The Node-RED editor runs in the browser. We routinely develop and test using
Chrome and Firefox. We have anecdotal evidence that it works in IE9.

We do not yet support mobile browsers, although that is high on our priority
list.

### Reporting issues

Please raise any bug reports or feature requests on the project's issue 
tracker. Be sure to search the list to see if your issue has already 
been raised.

### Creating new nodes

The plugin nature of Node-RED means anyone can create a new node to extend
its capabilities. Eventually, the nodes will be npm-installable, but we're not
there yet.
